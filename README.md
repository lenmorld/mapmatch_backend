## Inspiration
Modern meetup apps are too focused on "dating", we wanted to create an app that helps students in the city make new friends on campus fast. Which means no more stalling when it comes to time and place to meet, we implemented a location tracking for each person so that when they match, they can try to meet up immediately.

## What it does
Users can login to the app and fill out the criteria for the person they want to meet within a 1km radius, the app then tries to find a student that matches the criteria. Once found, the students are able to see eachother's locations and can easily meetup by looking at the pin points on the map.
